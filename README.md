i3d-engine
==========

This is a small data-oriented programming project using Opengl.
<br/>
It allows the creation of sheets which basically are 3d scenes.
<br/>
Over those sheets we can put entities like UI components, 3d object, or texts.
<br/>
<br/>
Every entities could be linked to multiple events!
<br/>
<br/>
Makefiles are available for linux and mingw32.
<br/>
You can use the tools/i3d-export.py script, to export your own 3d models via blender 2.65+ < 2.8
<br/>
<br/>
Demo sheets can be find inside the i3d-demo directory.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!
